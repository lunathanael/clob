# 2012-01-31, Lars Bilke
# - Enable Code Coverage
#
# 2013-09-17, Joakim Söderberg
# - Added support for Clang.
# - Some additional usage instructions.
#
# 2018-03-31, Bendik Samseth
# - Relax debug output.
# - Keep a copy of the coverage output for later use.
# - Updated coverage exclude patterns.
#
# 2018-01-03, HenryRLee
# - Allow for *Clang compiler names, not just Clang.
#
# 2018-01-03, Bendik Samseth
# - Only check compiler compatibility if in a coverage build.
#
#
# USAGE:

# 0. (Mac only) If you use Xcode 5.1 make sure to patch geninfo as described here:
#      http://stackoverflow.com/a/22404544/80480
#
# 1. Copy this file into your cmake modules path.
#
# 2. Add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt:
#      INCLUDE(CodeCoverage)
#
# 3. Set compiler flags to turn off optimization and enable coverage:
#    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-g -O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage")
#	 SET(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-g -O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage")
#
# 3. Use the function SETUP_TARGET_FOR_COVERAGE to create a custom make target
#    which runs your test executable and produces a lcov code coverage report:
#    Example:
#	 SETUP_TARGET_FOR_COVERAGE(
#				my_coverage_target  # Name for custom target.
#				test_driver         # Name of the test driver executable that runs the tests.
#									# NOTE! This should always have a ZERO as exit code
#									# otherwise the coverage generation will not complete.
#				coverage            # Name of output directory.
#				)
#
# 4. Build a Debug build:
#	 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
#	 make
#	 make my_coverage_target
#
#


# Param _targetname     The name of new the custom make target
# Param _testrunner     The name of the target which runs the tests.
#						MUST return ZERO always, even on errors.
#						If not, no coverage report will be created!
# Param _outputname     lcov output is generated as _outputname.info
#                       HTML report is generated in _outputname/index.html
# Optional fourth parameter is passed as arguments to _testrunner
#   Pass them in list form, e.g.: "-j;2" for -j 2
